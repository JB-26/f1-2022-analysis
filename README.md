# F1 Data Analysis 🏎

Welcome to the F1 Data Analysis for the 2022 season! 🏎

This repo will contain my workings (both Data Science and analysis) of how the drivers are doing in the 2022 season.

## Getting started

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management. Make sure you have Poetry installed!

Once you have Poetry installed, run the following in your terminal:

```
poetry install
```

And then:

```
poetry shell
```

This will create the virtual environment to run the cells in the Jupyter notebook. Choose the newly created virtual environment as the kernel in the Jupyter notebook.

__NOTE: This will require Python 3.8 to be available on your machine!__


## What's included?

There are a few Jupyter notebooks included in this repo:

- Analysis
- Fastest Lap

Each notebook will include a short description of it's purpose and where the data is held.

## Where does the data come from?

All the data comes from the Formula 1 website.
