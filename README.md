# F1 Data Analysis üèé

Welcome to the F1 Data Analysis for the 2022 season! üèé

This repo will contain my workings (both Data Science and analysis) of how the drivers are doing in the 2022 season.

## Getting started

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management. Make sure you have Poetry installed!

Once you have Poetry installed, run the following in your terminal:

```
poetry install
```

And then:

```
poetry shell
```

This will create the virtual environment to run the cells in the Jupyter notebook. Choose the newly created virtual environment as the kernel in the Jupyter notebook.

Can't see the environment listed?

Try running the following:

```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

__NOTE: This will require Python 3.8 to be available on your machine!__


## What's included?

There are a few Jupyter notebooks included in this repo:

- Analysis
- Fastest Lap

Each notebook will include a short description of it's purpose and where the data is held.

## Where does the data come from?

All the data comes from the Formula 1 website.
